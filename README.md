The aim of this project was to investigate the properties available for rent on Airbnb in Seattle. I applied various data cleaning and modelling techniques to analyse the data. Used Seaborn to create visualization. I gained insights into how Airbnb operates in Seattle. I was able to answer questions such as how many properties are in each neighbourhood, what is their capacity, how does the price vary across different locations, what are the monthly pricing trends and so on.
